"""Graph neural network models.

We use the following conventions for the network.

In the paper the x_1 to x_N we call initial node features.

After embedding we call them the node features at different iterations
and they are labeled in the paper h_1(0) to h_N(0) for the first iteration.

The distances, d_vw are fed into the RBF expansion to get initial edge features
which are labelled in the paper eps_vw. After the first edge update we get
e_vw(0) which are edge features.

In the first edge update we concatenate the two node features h_v(0) and h_w(0)
, which are both size C (latent_size) vectors, with the initial edge feature
eps_vw which is size k_max. The network then outputs an edge vector e_vw(0)
of size C (latent_size).
